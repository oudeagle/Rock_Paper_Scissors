# Rock_Paper_Scissors

This is a simple command-line rock, paper, scissors game. Written fully in C++, this is essentially a stab at using concepts learnt in C++ in a real situation. 

## The game
The game allows you to play against the computer by selecting one of three options: namely "rock", "paper", "scissors". The computer randomly picks one of these options presented, and the program determines whether the player won, lost or drew with the computer.
